# Medieval-Mayhem
This is a simple real time strategy game developed using Processing JavaScript that can be played on one device. 
Players need to collect resources and eventually build troops to attack the opponents base and destroy it.  

# Requirements
This runs on any modern browser and the files needed for it to undersand Processing JavaScript are included.
This only really works if you are using a computer and will probably be unplayable on a phone.

# Controls
Player 1 - This is the player at the top of the map:
Use WASD to move the selection box
Use Spacebar to select

Player 2 - This is the player at the bottom of the map:
Use the mouse to point towards the things that you want to select
Use left click to select

# House Types
Worker - This is the type that allows you to collect resources and when selected you automatically 
get assigned 4 of each type but you can change the number of each worker type from any worker house.
Builder - This allows you to upgrade your walls and castle defense.
Soldier - The most basic type of troop that have short range. All troop houses can be used to charge or retreat troops.
Archer – The basic ranged troops that do a little more damage but have less health than the soldier.
Knight – Stronger, faster troop that does more damage but cost more than others.
Catapult – This troop is the only one that shoots further then castle defenses and it will only attack the enemy castle.
